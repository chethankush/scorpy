Basic Ansible Interview Questions

    What is Ansible?
        Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.
    Explain the architecture of Ansible.
        Ansible follows a client-server architecture where the control node communicates with managed nodes over SSH. The control node contains the Ansible installation and executes tasks defined in playbooks.
    What are Ansible playbooks?
        Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks to be executed on remote hosts. They allow for the automation of complex tasks and configurations.
    How do you install Ansible?
        Ansible can be installed on various operating systems using package managers like apt or yum on Linux, pip on macOS and Windows, or through pre-built packages provided by Ansible.
    What is Ansible Tower?
        Ansible Tower is a web-based interface and dashboard for Ansible that provides features such as role-based access control, job scheduling, and graphical inventory management.
    What is idempotence in Ansible?
        Idempotence in Ansible refers to the ability of tasks to be executed multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial execution, ensuring consistent outcomes.
    How do you define hosts in Ansible inventory?
        Hosts in Ansible inventory are defined in the inventory file, typically located at /etc/ansible/hosts, and can be grouped into categories with assigned variables.
    Explain the difference between Ansible modules and plugins.
        Ansible modules are reusable units of code that perform specific tasks on managed nodes, while plugins extend Ansible’s functionality and include inventory scripts, connection types, and callback plugins.
    What are Ansible variables and how do you use them?
        Ansible variables are placeholders used to store values that can be referenced and reused in playbooks and roles. They can be defined at various levels and contain static or dynamic data.
